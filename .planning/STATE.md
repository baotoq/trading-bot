# Project State

**Project:** BTC Smart DCA Bot
**Milestone:** v1.0 (complete)
**Updated:** 2026-02-12

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-12)

**Core value:** Reliable daily BTC spot purchases on Hyperliquid with smart dip-buying multipliers
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone

## Current Position

Phase: All v1.0 phases complete (4/4)
Plan: N/A
Status: Milestone shipped
Last activity: 2026-02-12 — v1.0 milestone complete

Progress: ██████████ 100% (4/4 phases, 11/11 plans)

## Key Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full list (11 decisions, all marked ✓ Good).

## Known Risks

1. **Hyperliquid spot API less documented** — EIP-712 signing implemented but needs testnet verification
2. **No automated tests** — DCA logic, multipliers, and notification handlers lack test coverage

## Next Action

Start next milestone with `/gsd:new-milestone` to define new goals.
