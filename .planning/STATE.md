**Milestone:** v1.1 Backtesting Engine
**Updated:** 2026-02-12

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-12)

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-02-12 — Milestone v1.1 started

Progress: ░░░░░░░░░░ 0%

## Key Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full list (11 decisions from v1.0, all marked ✓ Good).

## Known Risks

1. **Hyperliquid spot API less documented** — EIP-712 signing implemented but needs testnet verification
2. **No automated tests** — DCA logic, multipliers, and notification handlers lack test coverage
3. **CoinGecko API rate limits** — Free tier has rate limits that may affect large historical data fetches

## Next Action

Define requirements and create roadmap for v1.1 backtesting engine.
