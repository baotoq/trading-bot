    provides: DcaBotDetailScreen registered at /home/bot-detail with parentNavigatorKey rootNavigatorKey
  - phase: 35.2-02
    provides: DcaBotDetailScreen fully implemented with 3-tab layout
provides:
  - Tappable navigation entry point from HomeScreen PortfolioStatsSection to /home/bot-detail
  - Chevron icon affordance indicating section is tappable

key-decisions:
  - "GestureDetector chosen over PressableScale for PortfolioStatsSection -- large section tappable area; PressableScale scale animation too heavy for content section"
  - "HitTestBehavior.opaque ensures full Row area (including empty space between PortfolioStatsSection and chevron) is tappable"
  - "Chevron icon uses Colors.white54 for subtle secondary visual weight -- not primary action emphasis"
  - "_buildContent signature updated to accept BuildContext as first param -- method is an instance method on HookConsumerWidget, context available from build() and passed down"

patterns-established:
  - "Pass BuildContext to helper methods needing context.push when called from build()"

# Phase 35.2 Plan 03: DCA Bot Detail Screen Navigation Entry Point Summary

**GestureDetector wrapping PortfolioStatsSection with chevron icon wires HomeScreen to /home/bot-detail, closing the DCA-UI-01 gap**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-22T14:18:02Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-22T14:18:52Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Added `import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart'` to home_screen.dart for context.push extension
- Updated `_buildContent` signature to accept `BuildContext context` as first parameter
- Updated both call sites in `build()` from `_buildContent(value)` to `_buildContent(context, value)`
- Wrapped `PortfolioStatsSection` in `GestureDetector` with `HitTestBehavior.opaque` calling `context.push('/home/bot-detail')` on tap
- Added `Icon(Icons.chevron_right, color: Colors.white54, size: 20)` as visual navigation affordance
- Confirmed zero analyzer errors

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add tappable navigation entry point from HomeScreen to DCA Bot Detail** - `0300032` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** _(docs commit follows)_

## Files Created/Modified
- `TradingBot.Mobile/lib/features/home/presentation/home_screen.dart` - Added go_router import, updated _buildContent signature to accept BuildContext, wrapped PortfolioStatsSection in GestureDetector with chevron affordance and context.push('/home/bot-detail') on tap

## Decisions Made
- GestureDetector chosen over PressableScale per plan spec -- scale animation is too heavy for a large content section; tap feedback alone is sufficient
- HitTestBehavior.opaque ensures the entire Row area is tappable, including empty space between the stats section and the chevron icon
- Chevron icon uses Colors.white54 (subtle secondary weight) rather than primary/accent color -- this is a navigation hint, not a primary CTA

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- DCA-UI-01 is now fully satisfied: route registered, screen implemented, navigation trigger wired
- Phase 35.2 is feature-complete with all 6 truths verified (Truth 1 was PARTIAL before this plan)
- Phase 36 can begin immediately
