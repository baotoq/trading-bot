# v3.0 Flutter Mobile — Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** v3.0 Flutter Mobile
**Audited:** 2026-02-20
**Status:** GAPS FOUND (process gaps — see note below)

## Important Context

All 10 "unsatisfied" requirements are **process gaps, not functional gaps**. The integration checker verified all 27 requirements are fully wired at the code level with 0 broken E2E flows. The issue is that phases 23, 24, 25, and 25.1 were completed without creating VERIFICATION.md files, and REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes were not updated. The code works; the verification paperwork is missing.

## Scores

| Category | Score | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Requirements | 17/27 | 17 formally verified, 10 orphaned (missing VERIFICATION.md) |
| Phases Verified | 3/7 | Phases 20, 21, 22 have VERIFICATION.md; 23, 24, 25, 25.1 do not |
| Integration | 27/27 | All requirements confirmed wired at code level |
| E2E Flows | 7/7 | Portfolio refresh, chart timeframes, infinite scroll, config edit, push purchase, push missed, Aspire orchestration |

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | VERIFICATION.md | Status | Requirements |
|-------|----------------|--------|--------------|
| 20 — Flutter Setup + Core Infrastructure | EXISTS | passed (5/5) | APP-01 to APP-06 |
| 21 — Portfolio + Status Screens | EXISTS | passed (5/5) | PORT-01 to PORT-05 |
| 22 — Price Chart + Purchase History | EXISTS | passed (8/8) | CHART-01 to CHART-06 |
| 23 — Configuration Screen | **MISSING** | unverified | CONF-01 to CONF-04 |
| 24 — Push Notifications | **MISSING** | unverified | PUSH-01 to PUSH-05 |
| 25 — Nuxt Deprecation | **MISSING** | unverified | DEPR-01 |
| 25.1 — Notification Handler Split | **MISSING** | unverified | (no requirements mapped) |

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Satisfied Requirements (17/27)

| Requirement | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final |
|-------------|----------------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| APP-01 | SATISFIED | provides listed | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| APP-02 | SATISFIED | provides listed | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| APP-03 | SATISFIED | provides listed | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| APP-04 | SATISFIED | provides listed | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| APP-05 | SATISFIED | provides listed | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| APP-06 | SATISFIED | provides listed | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| PORT-01 | SATISFIED | provides listed | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| PORT-02 | SATISFIED | provides listed | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |

| PORT-04 | SATISFIED | provides listed | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| PORT-05 | SATISFIED | provides listed | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| CHART-01 | SATISFIED | provides listed | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| CHART-02 | SATISFIED | provides listed | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| CHART-03 | SATISFIED | provides listed | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| CHART-04 | SATISFIED | provides listed | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| CHART-05 | SATISFIED | provides listed | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| CHART-06 | SATISFIED | provides listed | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |

### Orphaned Requirements (10/27) — Missing Formal Verification

| Requirement | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY | REQUIREMENTS.md | Integration Check | Final |
|-------------|----------------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| CONF-01 | missing | complete | [ ] Pending | WIRED | **orphaned** |
| CONF-02 | missing | complete | [ ] Pending | WIRED | **orphaned** |
| CONF-03 | missing | complete | [ ] Pending | WIRED | **orphaned** |
| CONF-04 | missing | complete | [ ] Pending | WIRED | **orphaned** |
| PUSH-01 | missing | complete | [ ] Pending | WIRED | **orphaned** |
| PUSH-02 | missing | complete | [ ] Pending | WIRED | **orphaned** |
| PUSH-03 | missing | complete | [ ] Pending | WIRED | **orphaned** |
| PUSH-04 | missing | complete | [ ] Pending | WIRED | **orphaned** |
| PUSH-05 | missing | complete | [ ] Pending | WIRED | **orphaned** |
| DEPR-01 | missing | complete | [ ] Pending | WIRED | **orphaned** |

**Note:** All 10 orphaned requirements were confirmed WIRED by the integration checker. The "orphaned" status reflects missing VERIFICATION.md files and unchecked REQUIREMENTS.md boxes — a process gap, not a functional gap.

## Integration Check Results

**Cross-phase wiring:** All 27 requirements have verified integration paths from Flutter UI → data layer → .NET API → database.

**E2E Flows Verified:** 7/7

1. Portfolio auto-refresh (PORT-01 to PORT-05) — COMPLETE
2. Price chart with timeframes (CHART-01 to CHART-04) — COMPLETE
3. Infinite scroll with filters (CHART-05, CHART-06) — COMPLETE
4. Config view/edit with validation (CONF-01 to CONF-04) — COMPLETE
5. Push notification on purchase (PUSH-01, PUSH-04) — COMPLETE
6. Push notification on missed buy (PUSH-02) — COMPLETE
7. Aspire without Nuxt (DEPR-01) — COMPLETE

**Notable Findings (non-blocking):**
- Orphaned legacy route `GET /api/dashboard/config` — sole consumer (Nuxt) removed; dead code
- `DELETE /api/devices/{token}` intentionally uncalled from Flutter — server-side FCM cleanup is the implemented mechanism
- `FcmNotificationService` scoping verified correct in both MediatR handler and BackgroundService contexts

## Tech Debt

### Phase 20: Documentation Inconsistency
- REQUIREMENTS.md text descriptions for APP-01, APP-03, APP-04 describe different approach than implemented (Keychain vs build-time, setup-screen vs snackbar, system theme vs dark-only)

### Legacy Code
- Orphaned route `GET /api/dashboard/config` can be safely removed
- `DELETE /api/devices/{token}` exists for future use but has no current caller

### Process Gaps
- No SUMMARY.md files contain `requirements-completed` frontmatter
- REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes not updated for 10 requirements (CONF, PUSH, DEPR)
- 4 phases (23, 24, 25, 25.1) missing VERIFICATION.md
